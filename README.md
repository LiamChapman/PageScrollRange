# Page Scroll Range Test

This is a basic script using only javascript and css to scroll a page using a HTML5 range input. 

It's generally pointless, but I just wanted to test it out and learn a few things. Thought I'd share it.

There are four events used, onload, onresize, onscroll and onchange.

Tested in Chrome and Safari. Should work with Firefox 23+ and IE 10+
